# Exploring the relationships between a set of variables and miles per gallon for a collection of cars

## Synopsis

Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, we are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG). We are particularly interested in the following two questions:

* Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG
* Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions
